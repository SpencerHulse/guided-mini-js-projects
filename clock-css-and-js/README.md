# clock-css-and-js

This is a simple clock made from css and js. It uses transform and transition to adjust the hands on a clock. The transform is updated using the native Date() function from js and other basic logic.

I added an if statement to remove the transition only when the degrees rolls over to prevent a visual bug. Additionally, I used CSS to add numbers to the face of the clock and adjusted the appearance of the hands to give them some individuality.
