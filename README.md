# guided-mini-js-projects

This repository houses a number of small JavaScript-centric projects provided for free by Wes Bos. I am using these to learn various concepts. Most will be done through instruction and as directed, but others will be played around with and taken further, or perhaps backward, depending on how well my experimentation goes.
